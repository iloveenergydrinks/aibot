## ⚙️ **Fine-Tuning:**

### **Make Hitler More Active:**

Edit `twitter_optimized.py`:
```python
# Line 66: Reduce cooldown
min_response_interval = 5  # Was 10

# Line 57: Increase controversy response rate
if random.random() < 0.5:  # Was 0.3 (50% instead of 30%)
```

### **Make Hitler Less Active:**

```python
# Line 66: Increase cooldown  
min_response_interval = 15  # Was 10

# Line 57: Decrease controversy response
if random.random() < 0.15:  # Was 0.3 (15% instead of 30%)
```

### **Add More Trigger Keywords:**

```python
# Line 29: Add to trigger_keywords
trigger_keywords = [
    'hitler', 'adolf', 'führer', 'fuhrer', 
    'nazi', 'germany', 'german',
    'jew', 'jewish',
    'third reich',  # Add these
    'world war',
